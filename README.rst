Projectively-Optimized Wavefunction Library (PrOWL)
---------------------------------------------------

Hopefully this one doesn't suck as hard.

Currently does:
    * APIG
    * AP1roG
    * APr2G (needs work)
    * "fancyCI" (soon)

Will do in the future (maybe):
    * APseq#G
    * APset#G
    * Open-shell AP*G
    * Dynamic correlation on AP*G
    * CI and/or CC stuff
    * Orbital optimization
    * Density matrices
